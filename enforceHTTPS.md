# Enforce HTTPS on all pages in your application
{: #enforce_https}

When you run your application in Bluemix with the express framework, the following changes need to be made to enforce HTTPS instead of HTTP on all pages in your application.

```
var express = require("express");
var app = express();

app.enable('trust proxy');

app.use (function (req, res, next) {
  if (req.secure || process.env.BLUEMIX_REGION === undefined) {
    next();
  } else {
    console.log('redirecting to https');
    res.redirect('https://' + req.headers.host + req.url);
  }
});
```
